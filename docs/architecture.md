# Architecture Decision Records

## Overview

This document contains the architecture decision records (ADRs) for the Personal Portfolio project. ADRs are a way to capture important architectural decisions made during the development of the project. Each decision is documented with its context, the decision itself, and the consequences of the decision.

## ADR 1: Monorepo Setup

### Context

The project consists of multiple applications and shared packages. Managing these applications and packages in a single repository can simplify dependency management, versioning, and development workflows.

### Decision

We decided to use a monorepo setup for the project, managed with pnpm workspaces and Turborepo. This allows us to keep all related code in a single repository and leverage the benefits of a monorepo.

### Consequences

- Simplified dependency management and versioning.
- Easier to share code between applications and packages.
- Improved development workflows with Turborepo.

## ADR 2: TypeScript for All Projects

### Context

TypeScript provides static typing, which can help catch errors early and improve code quality. It also offers better tooling support and developer experience compared to plain JavaScript.

### Decision

We decided to use TypeScript for all projects in the monorepo, including the backend (NestJS) and frontend (Next.js) applications, as well as the shared package.

### Consequences

- Improved code quality and maintainability.
- Better tooling support and developer experience.
- Increased initial setup and learning curve for developers new to TypeScript.

## ADR 3: NestJS for Backend

### Context

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It provides a modular architecture and integrates well with TypeScript.

### Decision

We decided to use NestJS for the backend application. NestJS's modular architecture and TypeScript support align well with our project requirements.

### Consequences

- Modular and maintainable backend codebase.
- Strong TypeScript support.
- Learning curve for developers new to NestJS.

## ADR 4: Next.js for Frontend

### Context

Next.js is a popular React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and other features that improve performance and developer experience.

### Decision

We decided to use Next.js for the frontend application. Next.js's features, such as server-side rendering and static site generation, align well with our project requirements.

### Consequences

- Improved performance and SEO with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- Better developer experience with built-in features and conventions.
- Learning curve for developers new to Next.js.

## ADR 5: Prisma ORM for Database

### Context

Prisma is a modern ORM that provides type-safe database access and integrates well with TypeScript. It supports various databases, including PostgreSQL, which we chose for this project.

### Decision

We decided to use Prisma ORM for database access in the backend application. Prisma's type-safe database access and TypeScript integration align well with our project requirements.

### Consequences

- Type-safe database access and improved developer experience.
- Strong TypeScript integration.
- Learning curve for developers new to Prisma.

## ADR 6: Tailwind CSS for Styling

### Context

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of predefined classes for building responsive and modern user interfaces. It allows for rapid development and easy customization.

### Decision

We decided to use Tailwind CSS for styling the frontend application. Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach and ease of customization align well with our project requirements.

### Consequences

- Rapid development and easy customization of user interfaces.
- Consistent and responsive design.
- Learning curve for developers new to Tailwind CSS.

## ADR 7: NextAuth.js for Authentication

### Context

NextAuth.js is a complete open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It provides a flexible and easy-to-use API for implementing authentication.

### Decision

We decided to use NextAuth.js for authentication in the frontend application. NextAuth.js's flexibility and ease of use align well with our project requirements.

### Consequences

- Simplified authentication implementation.
- Flexible and easy-to-use API.
- Learning curve for developers new to NextAuth.js.

## ADR 8: Docker for Deployment

### Context

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It provides a consistent environment for development, testing, and production.

### Decision

We decided to use Docker for deploying both the frontend and backend applications. Docker's containerization capabilities provide a consistent environment and simplify deployment.

### Consequences

- Consistent environment for development, testing, and production.
- Simplified deployment process.
- Learning curve for developers new to Docker.

## ADR 9: Monitoring and Error Tracking

### Context

Monitoring and error tracking are essential for maintaining the health and performance of the applications. They help identify and resolve issues quickly.

### Decision

We decided to set up monitoring and error tracking for both the frontend and backend applications. This ensures that we can maintain the health and performance of the applications and quickly resolve any issues.

### Consequences

- Improved application health and performance.
- Faster issue resolution.
- Additional setup and maintenance effort.

## ADR 10: Testing Strategy

### Context

Testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of the applications. A comprehensive testing strategy includes unit tests, integration tests, component tests, end-to-end tests, and API contract tests.

### Decision

We decided to implement a comprehensive testing strategy for both the frontend and backend applications. This includes unit tests, integration tests, component tests, end-to-end tests, and API contract tests.

### Consequences

- Improved application quality and reliability.
- Increased confidence in code changes.
- Additional effort for writing and maintaining tests.
